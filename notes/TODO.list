i) Vague roadmap for C2-Ray mod.

- Create visualisation pipeline. DONE.
- Remove OpenMP looping. DONE. Pushed 2014/01/02
- Read SourceList on node = 0 and only distribute sources to their relevant nodes.
- Read density field on each node and store only local density on each node.
- Alter MPI to be node domoain decomposed rather than master slave.
- Only calculate ionisation in MPI node a source resides in.
- Setup relevant data structures to aggregate ionisation info on borders between MPI nodes.
- Communicate data across boundaries and proceed with reionisation in a one-node shell around original source node.
- Re-implement threading. Not sure how at this stage. 

ii) Specific to do items:

- Check with Garrelt that using reorder = .TRUE. in MPI.F90 is not buggy.
